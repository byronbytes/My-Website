    -------MY BEGINNING -------
    <p></p>
    I started as a cringy YouTuber with no brain cells because times were way different. I was young and had no idea what I was doing.
    I had always been stuck at a certain amount of subscribers so I just quit because it's hard to get new subs. (Still have 156)
    Also the reason why I started YouTube was because one of my friends had a channel and I was inspired to make videos. 
    <p></p>
    In 2018 I found TikTok because of being spammed with ads and when I opened it it wasn't as cringy as  I thought it was going to be.
    Eventually I understood what to do on TikTok and I gained a bit of following. I currently only have 1.2k followers on TikTok.

    -------MY INTREST IN CODING-------
    <p></p>
    I had always been good with computers ever since 1st grade. I was on the teachers computer and I sent an entire email to the whole district saying hi (from the teachers email.)
    My dream was to make a chatting app becasue it seemed super cool, so once I was digging around looking for an app and I found this LITERAL SCAM called appypie which
    said "Free Forever" and yet 3 days later they magically appear with a "Please let us steal your money to continue working on your project"
    It sucked so bad and I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
    <p></p>
    Later I discovered that Visual Studio existed and I used that. First coding language was VB.NET because it looked easy. My first ever project was called Contacts+. 
    I could probably remake it to this day. I also attempted to make a chatting app but it failed miserablly. 
    <p></p>
    I learned that VB.NET was a dead language so NOW I am trying to learn C#, Python, HTML, and some other useful languages.
    Also that WinForms is dead and that I am going to learn WPF.

    -------MY INTREST IN CODING-------
    <p></p>
    I had always been good with computers ever since 1st grade. My dream was to make a chatting app becasue it seemed super cool, 
    so once I was digging around looking for an app and I found this LITERAL SCAM called appypie which said "Free Forever" and yet 3 days later they magically
   appear with a "Please let us steal your money to continue working on your project"  It sucked so bad and I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
   Also they have really weird staff.
    <p></p>
    Later I discovered that Visual Studio existed and I used that. First coding language was VB.NET because it looked easy. My first ever project was called Contacts+. 
    I could probably remake it to this day. I also attempted to make a chatting app but it failed miserablly. 
    <p></p>
    I learned that VB.NET was a dead language so NOW I am trying to learn C#, Python, HTML, and some other useful languages.
    Also that WinForms is dead and that I am going to learn WPF.
